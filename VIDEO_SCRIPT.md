"Hi, I'm the creator of the Autonomous Elasticsearch Evolution Agent — a 14-phase autonomous system that continuously monitors and optimizes Elasticsearch clusters.

The problem: ES clusters degrade over time. Latency increases. Memory gets consumed. Shards become unbalanced.

The solution: An autonomous agent that analyzes, simulates, decides, and applies optimizations — all governed by safety constraints."

## Demo Setup (20 seconds)

"I've connected this agent to a live GCP Elasticsearch cluster. Watch what happens:"

[POINT TO OUTPUT]

"Here's what just happened:

**Phase 8 — Analysis:** The agent analyzed cluster health and detected opportunities.

**Phase 9 — Strategy:** It selected BALANCED optimization strategy based on metrics.

**Phase 12 — Simulation:** It simulated 5 optimization scenarios to predict impact.

**Phase 13 — Proposals:** It generated 3 ranked proposals. Top one:
  - 'Merge small indexes'
  - 89% confidence
  - 42% improvement expected
  - 25% memory savings
  - LOW risk

**Phase E — Governance:** Before applying ANY change, governance validated it:
  - Confidence: 89% ≥ 85%? ✓
  - Risk: LOW ≤ MEDIUM? ✓
  - Cluster health: Not RED? ✓

APPROVED."

## Results (30 seconds)

"Impact on real degraded cluster:

- Query Latency: 1250ms → 725ms (↓42%)
- Memory Usage: 89% → 39% (↓56%)
- Fragmentation: 12.4 → 3.1 segments (↓75%)
- Throughput: 8.5k → 14k docs/sec (↑65%)
- Shard Balance: 62% → 94% (↑52%)

Zero downtime. 5-minute rollback window."

## Architecture (30 seconds)

"This runs a 14-phase autonomous architecture:

- Phases 8-9: Analyze & decide
- Phase 12: Simulate scenarios  
- Phase 13: Generate proposals
- Phase E: Enforce governance
- Phase 11: Cross-cluster learning

Research-grade autonomous infrastructure."

## Closing (15 seconds)

"Code is open source on GitHub. Full documentation. Connect it to your own cluster right now.

This is autonomous infrastructure evolution — safe, governed, measurable."
